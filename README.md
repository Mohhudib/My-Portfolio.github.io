# Mohammad Hudib — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
I am a Cybersecurity student and Red Team trainee, currently holding **CCNA** and studying for **CEHv13**.  

## Projects & Experience
Here are some of the projects and practical labs I have worked on:

- **SSH Protocol** — Setup and security analysis of SSH communication.  
- **Encryption Algorithms** — Implementation and testing of cryptographic algorithms.  
- **Cybersecurity Attacks** — Practical exercises including **DDoS** attacks, conducted safely in virtual machines (VMs).  

These projects were performed in controlled lab environments to strengthen my understanding of network security, penetration testing, and attack mitigation strategies.
